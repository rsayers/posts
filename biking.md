So I bought a new bike recently, a 2008 Giant Sedona. So far I'm really liking
it. I wanted something that would be good for commuting, riding the trace, and
some light offroading and in all 3 respects I've been very pleased with it.

  
  
  
With gas on the rise, my car not running, and really just having no good
reason not to I've started commuting to work by bike. My route is only about 4
miles although riding along 98 can be a bit scary at times. I think i know how
the main character in frogger felt. It will be interesting to see how this
works out with the weather getting hotter, but I'm determined to stick with
it.

  
  
  
I've also rode the Long Leaf Trace for the past 2 sundays. The first ride it
was me Rory, and Brandon and I think we rode about 15 miles. This ride was on
my Trek 4500 which is too big for me and has tires that are just not great for
long paved trips. This past sunday Rory and I went on a 30 mile round trip
which despite being longer and taking horse trails for a portion of the trip,
ended up being easier in some ways thanks to the new bike.

  
  
  
I'm also hoping that in addition to weight lifting this will be a boost to my
fitness level. Either way, I'm having a great time with it.
