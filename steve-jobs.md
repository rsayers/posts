As everyone knows by now, Steve Jobs has passed away at age 56.  He will be
missed.  Steve had a big impact on my life.  If he had never existed, it's
quite possible things would be different for me today.

  

I was a child of the 90's.  I was part of that last group that didn't always
grow up with a computer in the house.  I was into computers when the only kids
into computers were nerds.  I also grew up less than wealthy at a time when
PC's were very expensive.   This meant that the only computer my family could
afford was an antiquated Apple 2+.  To put it in context, at this point the
Pentium had been released as had the first PowerMac.

  

Thankfully this old Apple came with stacks of books as well, many of them on
the Basic programming language.  I was 13 at the time and this was my first
introduction to programming, something I'm still doing 17 years later.

  

Steve (along with other pioneers in computing) were also role models of mine
growing up.  As a middle school kid into computers, sci-fi, and other assorted
nerdy pursuits I was not exactly popular.  Knowing that guys like Jobs had
turned their passion for technology into something huge and made a great life
was something that helped me keep my head up.  I knew that the nerds would
eventually win.  To look at the world today, I would say we have.

  

I'll leave this post with Steve's commencement address from Stanford a few
years back.  I remember thinking it was one of the most inspirational things I
had heard when it was first posted, and I still feel it today.

  

So long Steve,  and thanks for everything.
