The space shuttle Atlantis and the crew of STS-121 is on track for a Thursday
launch. The mission is set to lift off at 4:31PM Eastern time and will deliver
the European Space Agency's Columbus module to the International Space
Station.

  
  
  
The Columbus module is a scientific lab which is also the ESA's major
contribution to the station.
