Tomorrow morning I leave for India. The flight departs New Orleans around 10,
which means I have to be at the airport at 8, which means I have to leave
Hattiesburg around 5:30.

  
  
  
I'm all packed up and pleased to announce I will be flying with no checked
baggage. All carry-on, so no fear of lost luggage and no change of anything
getting broken. This is also the first time I'm traveling without a computer.
In fact, the only device I'm bringing is a camera. This seems like an
appropriate trip to stay unplugged for a while.

  
  
  
I'll be posting updates as access permits from
[http://india.robsayers.com](http://india.robsayers.com/) so feel free to
follow that blog.

  
  
  
See everyone in three weeks!
