I guess I'm just a bad blogger. I've decided to try and be better about it.  I think that my blog used to be a spot to post lots of random things, and social media has taken over that role.

Social media for trivial things can be good, as I do still have this outlet for longer and more substantial content. With that in mind, I'm resolving to keep this damned thing updated more.  One post per week, that's my quota.  To help with this, I've finally cooked up a good auto deploy system using GitHub's webhooks and some shell script magic.  I'm going to do a writeup of my solution in a future post, so look out for that.
