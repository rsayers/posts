Title: Starting Over
Date: 2016-06-02 21:11:15+00:00

My old blog has posts going back to 2007 or so.  Looking back at it, a good deal of those posts were short and/or personal and generally things that these days would end up on Twitter of Facebook.

As I've switched blogging engines through the years, I have managed to keep all of these migrated and available.  On this migration, I've decided to not bother with that and start fresh.

My hope is that this blog will be used to post about hobbies, projects, and software development (although often those three are the same thing).  But these things tend to take on a life of their own, so we'll see.

I do have a handful of older posts that did have information that I'll be porting to this engine, plus my wordpress install will be left running, so nothing will be actually lost
