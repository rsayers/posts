In the past week I've made a few purchases for my car. They are:

  
  
  
1 Set of 205/50/15 Falken Azenis

  
2 Dellorto 40's

  
OBX Header

  
Brand Unknown side draft manifold

  
  
  
The carbs, manifold, and header are of course for the upcoming 16v swap. I'm
glad I'm finally purcashing parts for this as if nothing else, it at least
locks in my engine choice.

  
  
  
I'm probably putting the project on hold for now until after my christmas
shopping is finished. Hopefully though I'll have everything together and ready
to swap by early January.
