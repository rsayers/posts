If you enjoy coding, development, hacking, or anything similar... run, dont
walk to [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/).

  
  
  
It's the only social news site I follow closely, certainly the only site where
I actually read the comments. While most social news sites make me feel
braindead after reading user comments, Hacker News has a really sharp crowd.

  
  
  
So check it out!
