Tomorrow begins Retrochallenge 2012.  I didn't really have time for a better
project, so this time around I'm just doing some work on my Super Famicom.

  

I bought it last year in Akihabara, and it never quite worked right.  I
suspect the edge connector is just dirty, so I plan to take the whole unit
apart and give it a good cleaning.

  

I will also be retr0brighting the case to make it look new again.

  

If times permits, I may also break out my NES and spare TV and setup a retro
game station in my office.
