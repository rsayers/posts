I've decided to change around my computer setup. I currently use a Macbook as
my primary machine. It served me well for quite some time, but its cracking
case, constantly full speed fan, and horrible battery life have finally pushed
me away from the platform.

  
  
  
I've decided it will be replaced by a desktop and another laptop. For the
desktop I'm going to dust the cobwebs off my G4 mac mini, I will hopefully
have it running tonight after installing a new hard drive. I'm burning the
Ubuntu 7.10 ppc iso now.

  
  
  
For the laptop Im going to get an Asus eeepc. At 2lbs its very light, battery
life is supposed to be great thanks to it not having a hard drive and it seems
to fit my needs well. Never playing games has its advantages.

  
  
  
Right now my only debate is which eeepc to get. It's offered with 2, 4, or 8
gigs of flash storage, which the difference is so small I doubt it would
matter. I think it might be best to get the 2 gig model and use the money I
save on a 16gig sd card, but I'm not sure yet.

  
  
  
So I'll be selling the macbook before too long, I'm probably going to ask
around 700 for it, which seems fair given the current used prices. Let me know
if you are interested.
