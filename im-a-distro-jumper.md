Title: I'm a Distro Jumper

Since I made the last post about installing Puppy Linux I've since installed
Slackware 12.1 and Crunchbang. I'm pretty sure I'll be sticking with
Crunchbang, it's an Ubuntu based distro that's very light weight, using
OpenBox by default.

  
  
  
Slack was a fun experience, I got nearly everything working, but without
amazing skills, it was a bit quirky to use. Crunchbang however is working 100%
and very smooth.

  
  
  
A brief history of Operating systems I've run on my eeePc: Came with XP, the
same day I installed Fedora Core 8. Later on I installed eeeXubuntu, wasn't a
fan. Switched to Debian which I used for months but it was a tad slow. Went to
Puppy after that hoping it would solve the speed problem. It was ok, but
really unstable when using flash and just sorta strange to use. Then it was
Slack, learned a lot. Was going to try FreeBSD next, but read about Crunchbang
and decided to give it a try.

  
  
  
Running the array.org lean custom eee kernel. It boots fast and is quite
speedy. The only oddness was that the ath5k native driver worked extremely
slow, ended up using ndiswrapper on the XP drivers. Great success.
