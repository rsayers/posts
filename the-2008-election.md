The election is finally at an end. Barak Obama is to be our new president. I
did vote for Obama, but I cannot say I was a huge supporter. I'd like to
believe he is going to being about as much change as he claims, I remain
skeptical.

  
  
  
The Federal Reserve and the International Banking system is the actual source
of power that rules our country, by the time an election comes around, the
only 2 candidates left are the ones the banks have in their pockets already.
Take a look at the top contributors for both [McCain](http://www.opensecrets.o
rg/pres08/contrib.php?id=N00006424&cycle2=2008&goButt2.x=10&goButt2.y=14&goBut
t2=Submit) and [Obama](http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/contrib.php?cycle=200
8&cid=N00009638). Names such as Citigroup, JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs appear
in both. Care to guess why?

  
  
  
Despite my cynicism, I do hope that things will take a turn for the better. I
certainly like Obama's stances on health care of diplomacy. I hope his
powerful words are genuine. I hope we did not send another puppet of the
corporatacracy to the White House.
