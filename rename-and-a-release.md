So i've renamed RedBlosxom, it is now called Stream of Consciousness. A bit
wordy, but I've always thought it would be a cool name for a blog, so there
you go.

  
  
  
I also started a github account and have the first source release up there.
It's an exact copy of the file running this current site. I've got a few edits
I'd like to make soon, but I wanted to get something up. It's lacking real
documentation, but if you could get Blosxom working, this is pretty much the
same deal. You can find it at [SOC Github](http://github.com/rsayers/stream-
of-consciousness/tree/master)
