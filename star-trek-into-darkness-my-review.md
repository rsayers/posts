My fiance and I saw Star Trek into Darkness last Wednesday as part of a double
feature which started with the 2009 movie.  The internet of course needs one
more review by one more angry nerd... so here it goes.

  
I'll start off by saying that I was not a huge fan of the 2009 movie.  My
friend Shaun, of Star Trek Into Dorkness fame said that he thought it was a
fun movie but wished it had more on its mind.  I think that's a fantastic way
to look at it.  It was fun, it looked great, but just seemed shallow to me.

  
So with that said, I think this movie improved on that quite a bit.  I of
course have a number of complaints about it, but overall it was quite good and
I finally feel better about having J.J. at the helm of the franchise.

  
The good?  First and foremost, there were hard choices to be made.   From the
very start we realize that the crew just tossed the prime directive out of the
airlock in order to save a culture from imminent doom.  Kirk pays for this
choice with his command, and he questions Spock's loyalty.  Spock has to
struggle with duty vs. loyalty which I think is a great theme we see often in
Trek.

  
The plot is clouded up a bit when we realize that Admiral Marcus has been
manipulating Kahn to aid his own goal of starting a war with the Klingons.
The Enterprise is pretty much send on a suicide mission to really kick off the
war, as well as dispose of any evidence of conspiracy.  Once revealed, the
crew has to decide what side they are really on, and what the right thing is
to do.   I think its a great start to a plot that forces the crew to make
choices.

  
Other things I liked... The Klingons looked fantastic.  I think they finally
look as fearsome as they've always been written to be.  They threw in a few
call backs that were obscure enough that they didn't stick out as obvious
pandering, but let us know that they were preserving and respecting Trek's
past.

  
Of course it was also a beautiful film.  Lens flares aside, the effects were
great, and the ship is just so much eye candy.  I love that the engineering
section looks more like an engineering section, and not a deck of glowy
things.

  
Now,  as an aging nerd who has been a rabid Trekkie for over 20 years now, of
course I take issue with a lot of things.

  
First of all,
