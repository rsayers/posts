The site you are currently reading is now running on RedBlosxom, a
minimilistic blog package inspired by [Blosxom](http://www.blosxom.com/).

  
  
  
After reading about Blosxom i really liked how easy and simple it was, keeping
posts in plain text offers a lot of functionality and keeps things easy.
RedBlosxom is more or less a clone which i've written in Ruby. In keeping with
the theme of simplicity, the software is a single file which runs with eRuby.
I'm currently using mod_ruby, but one could just as easily run it in cgi mode.

  
  
  
I'm holding off on a release now, using my blog as a test bed to sort out any
bugs. There are still a few features I need to add (such as search), but for
the most part it is complete and appears to be working.
