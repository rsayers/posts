The previous post I made about switching hosts is gone. I managed to foul
things up bad enough that I just reinstalled from scratch. This time I'm
running Fedora 8 instead of Ubuntu 7.10.

  
  
  
I had hoped maybe another distro would cure the email problems I was having,
but it appears to still be broken.

  
  
  
At least this site works again I guess.
