Title: Final update

Unfortunately my final update is to mention my project will not be completed,
so I am officially out of the running.  I need to quit moving right before the
Retrochallenge begins!

  


  

My project was a recreation of the 8-bit themed I.T. Crowd intro in
QuickBasic.  I'm going to try and finish it up at some point, but right now I
have the music and just a little bit of the graphics complete.

  

Best of luck to everyone else!
