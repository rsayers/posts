This semester I have read a lot of works from both pagan and early Christian
writers, each proclaiming their religion as true, and the other sides as
false. I'm mainly talking about Celsus, Tertullian, Julian the Apostate and St
Augustine here.

  
  
  
One theme I notice is that in defending their own religion, both sides take a
very spiritual stance, citing miracles or victories their god has performed.

  
  
  
When attacking the other side however, they become extremely rational. They
are quite ready to point out how impossible a story from scripture or legend
may be, while thier own religion is full of similar tales.

  
  
  
No real point here, just found that interesting.
