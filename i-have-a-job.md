As mentioned before, my wife and I are moving to Austin in June. We decided to
move even if we didn't have jobs lined up in the hopes that we could land one
soon after arriving.

  
  
  
Thankfully that is no longer a worry as I've accepted an offer with [Life
Technologies](http://www.lifetech.com/) as a software engineer. Life Tech is,
in a very vague nutshell, a biotechnology company which produces equipment for
doing genetic research. Biotech is an exciting field and I'm thrilled be be
joining it.

  
  
  
We leave Hattiesburg a week from today. I'm sad to be leaving my home town,
all my friends, and many years worth of memories. I'm excited about the
prospect of a new and exciting job along with moving to a much larger city.
