I've been asked to provide a list of "stuff" I would not mind receiving for
Chrstmas.

  
  
  
I ask that anyone considering getting me anything instead use that money for
charity. By worldwide standards I would be considered wealthy and am in need
of nothing. Also, the more stuff I own, the more Karen complains about how
much stuff I have around the house :)

  
  
  
I've donated to the [American Jewish World Service](http://www.ajws.org/) in
the past and it appears to be a decent organization, if you have no other
charities in mind, this is a good one to go with.

  
  
  
  

  
  
  
But to those who just want me to post an amazon wishlist... [here is
that.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/2IO6NIG9HUOSA)
