I was in the middle of moving to Austin for the Summer Retrochallenge, I find
myself in the same situation this time around as well.  We just purchased a
house and that has kept us busy.  All my old hardware, soldering iron, etc are
still packed up, so I dont want to undertake a hardware project this time
around.  I've done software for the first two I entered, so I think it's time
for a change of pace.

  

This go around I'll be indulging my urge to create, my goal is to create artsy
stuff related to retrocomputing.  I will probably end up doing a fair bit of
photography, but I want to do some drawing and maybe even painting.  Either
way I'll be raiding the wife's art supplies and hopefully creating something
worth looking at.
