Well, I did some sketches. They were rubbish.  I have little hope of producing
anything worth viewing so I'm changing the project.

  


  

I've decided instead to do a DOS demo.  Way back when QuickBasic was my
favorite language I coded a bunch of neat little animations.  I'm going to see
if I can come up with anything interesting 12 or so years since I've really
touched QuickBasic.  There's not much time left, but I think I have time to
hack out something neat... we'll see!
