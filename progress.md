So my first order of business was to get my Replica 1 kit working.  The last
time I tried it, I was using a keyboard a scavenged from a non-working II+.
This time around I had a ps2 keyboard laying around and tried that instead.

  
The results?

Huzzah!  So this means there was something wrong with the ascii keyboard
interface I guess.  There's also some weirdness with the ps2 kb,  but it seems
to be ok if i wiggle the ps2 connector on the board.  I'm sure there's just
some dodgey soldering at play here.

  
I'm not entirely sure what my next steps are for this project.  But I'm glad
to see it's finally alive after being on a shelf for so long.

  
Next up for the WW2013... Finish the restoration of my Super Famicom.  It's
currently all apart and in zip lock bags.  I just need to make a trip to the
store to get the things I need to retr0bright the case,  then clean all the
connectors inside... in theory this should get it running well.
