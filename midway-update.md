It's coming along! Thanks to my friend [John
Havard](http://tumblr.johnhavard.com/), I have a working eprom. I ordered
another chip and had it sent to him, which he promptly programmed and sent my
way. 

Last night I got the data and address lines wired up between the cpu,
ram, an rom. I had actually done this step already, but did not plan very well
and had to start over. 

I'll be out of town this weekend, but I'm planning to
smuggle my parts in my luggage to sneak in some building while we're away.
