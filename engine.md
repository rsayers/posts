I had planned on rebuilding a bluetop 4age for my 86, I instead found a pretty
good deal on a 0-mile high comp short block and decided to go with that. I
think I came out ahead if you figure in how much machine work + parts would be
for a rebuild. Another upside is that this will give me higher compression and
oil squirters.

  
  
  
I also purchased a bluetop head a few days ago. I would have gone with a
redtop head, but I already have a largeport manifold for my carbs, and a
friend had a head which already had new valve seals and had been decked
recently. I'm considering getting the Toda 16v springs as they're only $120.
I'd love to get a set of cams while I have everything apart, but I just don't
see that in the budget right now.

  
  
  
The list of things I have to buy to complete the swap is getting lower. Up
next is carb parts (jets and things), ignition (using a GM hei with fixed
advance), fuel system (pump and fpr), clutch/flywheel, and a distributor. It
seems like a lot but I've purchased so much already. I keep telling myself
it's a good investment since I'll have a rebuilt engine which should (in
theory) last another 20 years. I'll just keep saying that...
