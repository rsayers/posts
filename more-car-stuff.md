In preparation for my Thanksgiving travels I was attempting to get my new
tires mounted Wednesday afternoon. After finally finding a shop that had not
closed early, I hopped in my car and headed that way.

  
  
  
I didn't get very far before realizing i have very little pressure in my
clutch pedal. I had noticed the slave cylinder leaking before, so I wasn't too
surprised. Today I finally got around to rebuilding that. I actually didn't
realize those were so simple. I'm glad I purchased a $10 kit instead of the
entire $25 cylinder itself.

  
  
  
My intake manifold also came in yesterday. It turns out to be a TWM unit. Im
not certain about how the throttle linkage is going to work, hopefully my
carbs will be here soon so i can start sorting that out.

  
  
  
Shout out to K-Ran. Woo.
