On [Hacker News](http://hackerne.ws/) there have been a couple posts today
about Zed Shaw's [Free Hackers Union](http://freehackersunion.org/). It's an
interesting idea, provoding a venue for geeks to talk about and show off geeky
things. Art, electronics, and code are all fair game.

  
  
  
We should get something started like that in the Hattiesburg area. I know of
ton of people involved in projects or have an interest in that sort of thing,
it would be great to gather and see who is working on what, help eachother
out, provide feedback and such.

  
  
  
So who's down for a monthly meetup at Javawerks?
