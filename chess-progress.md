I've been playing quite a bit of chess for a while now. I went through a
period where I was just playing whatever seemed like a good idea, with no
concept of spatial control, material value, or any other basic concepts.

  
  
  
After reading some articles on basics, I was doing a little better, but was
still pretty awful. I worked with a chess coach for a while which was a big
boost to my game. He introduced a lot of concepts to which I was previously
ignorant. For quite a while after this though I still felt like my game was
not very good.

  
  
  
Recently though I've made a few breakthroughs that I'm very happy with. This
has come from a lot of playing, self analyizing games, along with using lots
of chess puzzles. This has helped me see attack combinations I had not been
able to see before. Concepts like deflection and double attacks are just now
starting to become clear and already changing the way I play a lot. As a
consequence it has also boosted my confedence quite a bit, which may have been
the most important development so far.

  
  
  
Below is a game I recently finished. It was a player similar to my own skill
level but we played very differently. He concentrated on early attacks while I
focused entirely on development.
