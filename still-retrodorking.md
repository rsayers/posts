Title: Still Retrodorking

So even though my project is complete, I'm still messing with retrostuffs.


First and foremost I'm working on learning 6502 programming by using the Kim-1
emulator some more. I've just about got a Fibonacci sequence generator
working. When you take away things like variables, or even mnemonics for
instructions... you have to think a bit differently. The little bit of asm
I've done in the past (all x86 Linux), you get used to having a pretty rich
set of instructions and lots of registers, not so with the 6502. Anyhow, I
plan to get this code working over the weekend and posted with instructions on
how to run it in the emulator. 

Of course if you've been keeping up with the
Retrochallenge for any amount of time, you know that my favorite retromachine
is the Tandy Model 100... after a couple years of neglect, mine came out of
the attic this evening and has been getting some use. I decided since the
assembly bug has bit me, and I feel I have a better grasp on what's going on
under the hood (or bonnet for our friends in the UK), I would take a crack and
coding on this machine. Without my serial cable I can't transfer programs, so
getting as assembler onto the machine isn't an option right now, but I'm hag
some success converting the instructions hex value to decimal, and poking them
to the appropriate addresses. Fun stuff! 

I also took the time this evening to
go through the list of participants and see how everyone else was doing.
There's some really cool projects out there. Best of luck to everone on our
final weekend!
