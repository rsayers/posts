Title: Remember that car I had?

So my Corolla has not run in a few months, one night it lost power, made a bad
knocking sound, and started to overheat a bit. It's been parked ever since.

  
  
  
Yesterday I finally finished ordering the rest of the parts needed to complete
my 4age swap. The throttle levers and velocity stacks for my carbs, motor
mounts, and speedomoter gear. Small list, I'd just been too lazy to get around
to ordering it.

  
  
  
So once the shop has room, I'll have my car in there and should hopefully have
the long block in soon. I'll sort out fuel and spark once that is done.
