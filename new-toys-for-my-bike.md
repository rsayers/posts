Title: New toys for my bike

Ryan recently purchased a bike, his is a comfort style bike like mine but a
Schwinn. After riding it on the trace a bit I immediately fell in love with
those 700c tires. Narrow and 85psi drops the rolling resistance and makes it
go with less effort.

  
  
  
My first thought was to purchase a set of 700c wheels, but after doing a
little investigating I found that I could get 1.25" slicks for my mtb wheels
that would also hold 85psi. I ordered a set and they should be here monday. I
imagine I will lose what little off road capabilities I once had, but since I
pretty much always ride on tarmac, it should be fine.

  
  
  
Also arriving monday is a set of trekking or butterfly handlebars. These
should allow me to have 4 different hand positions vs. the single position I
have now with my raised mountain style bars. The goal here is to eliminate
fatigue on longer rides that I normally get. This should also allow me to
finish a ride without upper back pain I sometimes get. Also bought a couple
rolls of black grip tape to wrap them up.

  
  
  
As a longer term plan, I'm also thinking about painting my bike, I really like
the look of flat black frames, I did however just buy the bike in May, so it
is still fairly new (even though I have about 600-700 miles on it), but it's
already scratched up enough that a paint job would certainly improve its
looks.
