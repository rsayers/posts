I guess a lot has been going on lately and I really havn't updated much.
Here's a rundown:

  
  
  
**School:** This has been the biggest thing lately. I started taking classes at USM last wednesday, 1 week later I'm enjoying it very much, but was not expecting it to be as difficult as it is. I'm finding it to be pretty challenging but in a good way. Learning new things always excites me. Let's see if I can maintain the enthusiasm for as long as it takes.  

  
  
  
**Work:** Work is going well. I'm officially customer support, but lately I feel more like a web developer who occasionally has to take support calls. Lots of projects in the pipeline here, I'm happy to be enjoying this sort of work again. I feel that I've grown a lot as a programmer in the past year or so. I'm able to complete semi-complicated projects in a fraction of the time it used to take me and have been ending up with a lot more reusable code. Happy about that.  

  
  
  
**Cars:** My car is at a standstill again, between work and school I've had no time to work on it. Looks like weekends will be all the time I have from now on. Gotta make plans to make the most of that. Karens car popped a timing belt, gotta replace that asap. Finally hit 30mpg in the metro, gotta get that back on the road soon!  

  
  
  
**Mud:** Working on a mud with havard. What started as a normal mud using a rom-based server turned into writing our own server, first in tcl on aolserver, then in ruby, then to ada, and now we've settled on lisp. We've already comitted more code in lisp than all other langauges combined. I'm having a blast just learning Lisp, I can see it replacing ruby as my langauge of choice.  

  
  
  
**Biking:** Still riding a bike everywhere, in a couple weeks Im going with rory on a trip down the natchez trace to go camping. Carrying just what gear I can fit in a back or on my rear rack. Should be fun.  

  
  
  
**Karen:** She now has a job and has turned 21, so congrats to her on both counts, woo!
