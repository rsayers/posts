So this evening I finished soldering the Replica 1.  I put power to the board
before adding any chips and made sure there was power where there should be.
I added the video chip and I did not get the cursor I was told I would see.

I did what any logical person would do... I plugged in the rest of the chips
and figured I could sort it later.

I didn't.

It's sending some sort of signal to my monitor, but certainly no text.  I
figure I'll take a look at it tomorrow and maybe I'll see something I missed.
I did have a few cold solders which I fixed.  I also had a couple pins I
missed soldering completely.  My biggest fear (just because it would be such a
PITA to fix) was that I misread a resistor.  Being colorblind, resistors are
always fun to deal with.

My trusty multimeter tells me every single resistor on the board has exactly
the value it should.  So I'll put it up for tonight and look at it with fresh
eyes later.

I recently went back to Mississippi to get the rest of my stuff out of
storage, including a museum's worth of old hardware.  Instead of playing with
the Replica 1 tonight,  I fired up a //e and played a few games from
