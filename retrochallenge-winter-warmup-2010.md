It's that time again! From the official announcement:

  

> The RetroChallenge "Winter Warm-up" 2010 is officially slated to run from
January 1st to 31st, 2010.

>

>

  
  
RetroChallenge is a fairly informal "contest" whose sole aim is to encourage
owners of obsolete systems to do something (anything) with them.

>

>

  
  
Projects are self-assigned and can include just about anything, from
programming to hardware hacks; restorations; multimedia... whatever floats
your boat.

>

>

  
  
RetroChallenge is open to rosy-cheeked noobs and hoary old wizards alike.
