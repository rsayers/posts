A [recent post](http://www.bikecommuters.com/2009/01/30/car-free-fridays/) on
[BikeCommuters.Com](http://www.bikecommuters.com/) talks about a program in
Los Angeles to promote car-free Fridays. This is to encourage people to bike
to work each Friday. I applaud LA for doing this... but why stop there?

  
  
  
Let's get everyone on this! I encourage everyone reading this to take the bike
to work on Friday. One day per week is a really easy commitment to make. If
you work Mon-Fri, then you are cutting your carbon emissions by 1/5th. It
would not take many people for that to make a big impact. Not to mention how
great riding is for your health.

  
  
  
So everyone dust off that old bike in the garage, and start riding to work on
Fridays!
