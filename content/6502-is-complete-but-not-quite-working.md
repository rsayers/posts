 In the software world, "code complete" means you have finished coding something,
but have yet to start on the actual hard part, debugging and actually making
it work.  In that respect, my Retrochallenge project is wire complete?  I
spent today finishing up wiring the beast.  I plugged it in, opened my
terminal, and there was gibberish being printed!  Grounding the reset would
cause it to stop, and then ungrounding it would start the gibberish over
again.  I think that's progress? 

My next steps will be to go though each pin
on each chip again and trace where it is connected.  With this rats nest of
wires, it is very possible that I have something connected wrong.
