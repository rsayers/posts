These aren't resolutions as much as goals I guess.  But here it goes anyhow:

  

  

  1. Weigh 155 lbs... at least for a little while.  Going for a run or hitting the gym is easy for me.  Resisting food... not so much.  Try as I might, I can't out-train my diet.  To this end I'm tracking everything I eat in an android app.  155 may not be optimal for me, but I want to do it just for the exercise of dropping a decent amount of weight.  I was 162 at my lowest this year, to it's not a huge leap from there.
  

  2. Ride my Vespa.  This of course also means getting it running again.  The old Vespa is a new platform for me, so I'm dealing with the learning curve.  Fortunately most issues I've run into have been from me expecting something to be more complicated than it is.  These bikes are simple.
  

  3. Do a drift day.  I love drifting, but I sorta suck at it.  There are track events where I can do this legally and get feedback.  I'll be doing at least one this year.
  

  4. Run a marathon.  I'm already signed up for the Austin marathon, I just have to run it now.
  

  5. Leave the country.  I have no particular country in mind, but I plan to travel at least once.
  

  6. Learn a language.  I like to dabble with languages,  I need to buckle down and learn one.  I'm thinking French would be a good one.
  

  7. Stop being financially stupid.  I need to attack some debt, and get better at saving.  I'm really bad with finances, that changes this year.
  

  8. Convert my life to use the metric system - Metric (or more correctly SI) is a better system, everyone knows this.  Every time I travel I love that I get a chance to use it for everything.  I suppose this is one of those "be the change" sort of things.  We'll see how long I can keep this up.
  

  9. Write a game - I've wanted to write a real game forever,  time to get this one off my to-do list.
  
  

I of course have more things, but I think these are a good place to start.
Time to get started!
