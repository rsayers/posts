I think most people who read this already know, but I figured I would post it
for those who did not. I've decided to convert to Judaism.

  
  
  
That's sort of a strange thing to arrive at for most people I suppose, but in
the course of reading about the religion as merely a topic of curiosity I
began to realize I liked a lot of what I was reading. I've been going down the
path for a few months now. I've met with the rabbi here once. I was not
exactly discouraged, but I was made known that It's a choice I should not be
making lightly.

  
  
  
I've discussed it with my friends, father, and most of all Karen. So far
everyone is encouraging. I suppose the only big question mark is the upcoming
wedding, and even moreso the children down the line. I've been attending
shabbat services when I can make it, and going to the adult education classes
offered at the synagogue. I've also been reading and watching anything I can
get my hands on related to the topic. Everything I've done so far has only
drawn me closer to the faith and at this point I'm going forward with it.

  
  
  
I'm hoping to meet with the rabbi again soon to discuss this further. I'm not
exactly sure what my next step is or how long the process is going to take,
but I'm excited about what lies ahead.
