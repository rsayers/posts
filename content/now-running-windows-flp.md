So I did the unthinkable, I wiped my Linux parition and am now running
[Windows
FLP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Fundamentals_for_Legacy_PCs) on my
eee Pc. I'm a huge Linux fan, but on the marginal hardware the eee has,
Windows is just faster and much more usable.

  
  
  
FLP is a stripped down version of Xp designed to run on Windows 98 class
machines. After installation I was only using a bit over 600 megs of space,
that's great when you only have 4 gigs to start with. Flash was another big
deciding factor. The performance of flash under Windows is simply better than
Linux. When much of your content comes through Flash now, a slow machine with
Linux on it just doesn't hold up well.

  
  
  
I have to wonder why Microsoft has kept this version away from the public.
It's a perfect OS for a netbook.
