About two years ago I was in Bed Bath & Beyond to pick up a new french press
to replace one that had gone missing. I noticed that they also had the
[Aeropress](http://aerobie.com/products/aeropress.htm) which I had seen
mentioned in blogs before. At $25USD, it was a good bit cheaper than any
French press they had, so I decided to give it a shot. It's been great for
standard coffee, in my own home I have produced the best cup of brewed coffee
I've ever had. 

Recently I was in the mood for iced coffee. I googled a bit to
try and find ways to do iced coffee with the aeropress, but none of the
methods seemed to produce what I had in mind. With a little bit of
experimentation, I ended up with two receipes that seemed to work pretty well.

**Hot brew method** 

This follows the usual standard for making iced coffee,
brew it hot, cool it down, enjoy. I start with a scoop of beans, ground as
fine as my cheap grinder will go. This doesnt have an adjustment, I just let
it run longer to get a finer grind. Heat up water in a kettle to 175F/80C.
Combine the ground coffee and hot water in the Aeropress inverted-style and
let steep for 1-2 minutes. 

I then stuck the whole unit in my freezer for
around 2 hours to let it cool off. Once the press was very cold to the touch,
I pressed into a tall glass and added soy milk and raw sugar to taste. 

This
method is good when you're in the mood for coffee soon. If you have a bit more
time however... 

**Cold brew method** 

I learned about this method of brewing
from a local vendor who had a booth setup at the Circuit of the Americas
during MotoGP. The coffee does not come out bitter at all, in fact, it has a
slight natural sweetness to it. In cold-brewing (sometimes called New Orleans
Style), you steep the ground coffee in room temp or cold water for 12+ hours.


For the aeropress method, I ground the same amount of coffee and added it to
the interted Aeropress. Then I filled the rest with plain tap water and
stirred until it was mixed as well as I could get it. I then put the cap on it
and stuck it in the fridge overnight. The next morning when I got up for work,
I pressed it and had a taste. I could have easily left out the milk and sugar,
as the flavor was great. I did end up adding the milk and sugar, but in
smaller amounts than I did for the hot-brew method. 

The resulting beverage was
easily one of the best iced coffees I've had. As a bonus, it packed quite a
kick and woke me up in a hurry.
