Title: My car stops!

I decided I wanted to address the brakes on my car. Sure they worked fine, but
the rotors were in need of replacement soon, it was using unknown pads, 20
year old lines and calipers. If i was going to do it, I wanted to do it and
not worry about it again, so I went with a full brake system refresh.

  
  
  
The rotors were replaced with brembo blanks (crossdrilled and slotted rotors
are more prone to cracking, and modern pads don't dust or gas, this negating
the need for spectial rotors). The lines were replaced with goodridge g-stop
lines, pads are Hawk HPS, and all calipers were disasembled, cleaned, and
rebuilt with all new seals.

  
  
  
The whole process was more of an ordeal than I would have liked, I used a ton
of fluid with all the bleeding that was required, but it's finally back
together and working very well.

  
  
  
In other news, parts needed for my motor swap are nearly all here. The only
big question mark is the chokes, jets, etc I need for my carbs, one store I
contacted has yet to contact me back, and it seems like most places which
supply what I need are in the UK. Next week sometime I think I'll have my long
block built with the ignition system ready to go. My Holley red fuel pump and
frp also arrived yesterday, so I need to start planning a fuel system.
