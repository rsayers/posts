For those who don't already know, I'm going to India this May for the USM
"Religion In India" class. To say I'm excited would be an incredible
understatement.

  
  
  
I just completed all the paperwork to get my tourist visa for India. The trip
is already paid for, after this all I will need to do is show up at the air
port on the departure date. Woot.

I'm not sure how much communication I will have while I am there. Phone calls
will almost certainly be out, and internet access will probably be limited to
internet cafes. I'm not even 100% sure I'm bringing my eeePc, so we will see.
