It's once again time for my year-end post.  Looking back, it appears as though
I skipped this tradition at the end of last year.  I was busy moving between
temporary homes and purchasing a house at that time, so I suppose I can be
forgiven for neglecting to blog.

  

It would be remiss if I did not write about 2011.  It was such an eventful
year, I'm not quite sure where to start.  I made a number of resolutions, so I
suppose that's as good a place as any to begin.

  

I decided to be a little ambitious at the start of the year and wrote down 7
things I wanted to accomplish:

  

  

  1. Run the Warrior Dash - I did this in November and was very pleased with my time.
  

  2. Get in better shape - I killed this one.  I'm training for my 2nd marathon and my deadlift is just north of 300 lbs.  I stopped doing p90x after hurting my back and never started it again.  During my divorce I started going to the gym as a way to blow off steam.  I've stuck with that pretty religiously and am happy to say I'm far stronger than I've ever been.
  

  3. Visit Europe - I was happy to be in Rome for my 30th birthday this year.  It was during a pretty rough patch of my life and was a welcomed escape from everything going on at the time.  I met the most amazing people there and credit many of them for helping me get my life back on track.
  

  4. Take up another sport - I played softball for my company's team as shortstop.  I wasn't particularly good, but I had fun and enjoyed getting to know some of my coworkers better.
  

  5. Get my degree - This is the one that wont be happening,  I'm extremely close, but this wil probably happen in January.
  

  6. Get into mountain biking - Very recently I picked up a new MTB and have done a little riding.  Not as much as I would like, but hopefully I can get out and explore Austin's trails a little better soon.
  

  7. Get a project scooter - A couple months ago I picked up a 63 Vespa VBB.  It's a good looking bike that I'm trying to get back into running condition.  The hardest part is the learning curve involved in a completely new platform. 
  
  

6 out of 7 isn't bad I guess, especially considering the degree is only going
to be a month late.

  

It's hard for me to discuss this past year without mentioning the divorce.  I
briefly talking about it before, but as time has gone by my perspective has
changed a little.  A divorce is one of those life changing events which I
thing is second only to the death of a loved one in how it impacts you.
Having lost loved ones and been divorced, I dare say the pain of divorce is
worse.   I always try to spin things positively, and (with the help of an
excellent therapist) I used that event to help motivate me to change for the
better.  The number one change that came from all of it was the increase in my
self confidence.  I think for the first time in my life I have a realistic
view of who I am.

  

In February, my former co-worker, Jason, became my current co-worker and
roommate.  It's been cool.

  

In March I bought my first motorcycle.  After riding a scooter for some time,
I decided I wanted a big bike.  I did the sane thing and purchased a small
bike.  I've enjoyed it a lot, but I think I'm ready to move up to something
bigger and/or more practical.

  

In August I had the opportunity to get what for me had been on my list of
dream cars, a Mazda RX8.  I've long been a fan of sports cars and the rotary
engine.  The RX8 was the perfect car for me and I've enjoyed every moment of
owning it.

  

As mentioned above, I went to Rome.  The eternal city is truly a place of
magic.  You feel very small in a city built by men who wanted to be remembered
through the ages.  It's a city where you casually overlook loads of "new"
buildings from medieval and Renaissance times in search of structures from
antiquity.

  

On a bit of a whim, I took a second trip on November to Tokyo.  I had the best
time there and crammed a lot of activity into a pretty short visit.  It was
the best trip I've taken and I can't wait to return.

  

The best thing that happened to me in 2011?  Easy.  I met Marybeth Fell.  We
met on OK Cupid, both of us in recovery from similar situations.  From the
very first message I could tell she was like no other person I'd ever met.
The fact she has stumped me in Star Trek trivia is quite the plus.  We're just
great friends, and we get along well.  Even when things get hard, they are
still easy.  I could not have asked for a better relationship.

  

If Jack Donaghy were to describe my past year, I'm quite certain he would say
i was Reaganing.  I can't imagine next year being any better honestly.  Even
if it's worse, I'm sure 2012 will be great.  Happy New Years to you all.
