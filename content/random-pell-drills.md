Years ago when I was doing mixed martial arts, I would use the [Bas Rutten MMA Workout](http://www.amazon.com/BAS-RUTTEN-MMA-Workout-CD-DVD/dp/B00CXS6T02)  to get in a workout when I was not in the gym.  Basically it's a series of audio cds where various boxing, or kickboxing combinations are spoken and you have to perform them quickly.  

Lately I've been more interested in Western Martial Arts (more or less European style sword fighting) and have been working out at home pending getting involved with a local group.  I decided to see if I could generate a similar workout for sword drills.

I already have a [pell](http://www.thearma.org/essays/pell/pellhistory.htm) in my back yard, and had mostly done what is called the ["1-6" drill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGL8aIB6bic) which consists of striking each of the 6 target zones on the pell sequentially, and then striking a second target immediately after.  The goal is to be able to strike twice quickly and fluidly.  

With that in mind, I decided to generate a workout audio file that would create random combinations for me to strike.  This setup will have me strike 1, 2 or 3 targets per attack, and then rest 2,3, or 4 seconds after each. 

The script to do this is here:

After creating a file and converting it to mp3, I took it for a test spin and was pleased with the workout.  In addition to training accuracy and transitions. You are forced to think quickly and react.  I'm far from knowledgeable in this field, but it looks like it could be a good tool.  

You can listen to a sample generated from this [here](http://media.robsayers.com/workout.mp3). It's a little over 5 minutes long.
