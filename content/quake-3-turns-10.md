Quake 3 Arena is now 10 years old now.

I can recall excitedly waiting for new screenshots, checking out the leaked
vender test copy, and downloading the demo over dialup. Quake 1 was the first
game that really hooked me, but Quake3 was the game I certainly played the
most. I dare say they got this one pretty much perfect, this claim is
reinforced by its popularity today. 10 years later this game still has a huge
following both with the original and with Quake Live.

It's rare when a game comes out that has reply value like Quake3 has. and in
Id software's case they have managed to pull this off many times. Many people
still play the original Doom (in fact I'm assisting in running a D2 tournament
for this winters RetroChallenge), Quake1 still has a big following, even
Quake2. It's amazing that one company can produce so many timeless titles.

Quake 3 holds a special place in my heart, I have many fond memories of Lan
parties, QuakeCons, and late nights playing on the internet. Through a video
game I met many great people. Many of my closest friends I have today I met
through Quake.

So Happy birthday Q3A. Here's to another 10 years of camping with the railgun.
