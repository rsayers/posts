Title: Now running Puppy Linux

With my Debian install still not as responsive as I would like, I went ahead
and wiped the SSD to install [Puppy Linux](http://www.puppylinux.org/).
Despite the somewhat goofy name, it works pretty well.

  
  
  
Unlike most distros, it pretty much runs in single user mode and you are
always root. While you certainly wont be using it to deploy servers, it does
run quite nice on very modest hardware. The eeePc i actually overkill for this
OS. The downside is it looks like you took a time machine 10 years into the
past and played with a distro there. It looks... dated. Not a huge deal
however, what you lose in eye candy you gain in usability.

  
  
  
Right now everything works, sound, wifi, all that. Just need to get Ruby and
Emacs installed and I'll be set!
