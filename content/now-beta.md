So the blog software is now considered beta, it's feature complete and seems
to be working well. As you can see by this site (if you arent reading the rss
feed) I have templates working now, the default theme is still the one I
cooked up for the Alpha release. I also made a lot of other changes, a big one
being Ruby 1.9 support.

  
  
  
For the 1.0 release, I'm planning to create a bundle of some nice-to-have
plugins in an optional package. The core program will remain 1 small script
which can still be dropped in a variety of environments.

  
  
  
But for now, [have a look](http://github.com/rsayers/stream-of-
consciousness/tree/master) at the latest release.
