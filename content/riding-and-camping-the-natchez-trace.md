Tomorrow morning Rory and I will depart on the Natchez trace in Ridgeland for
Port Gibson MS where we will camp out before riding back the next morning.
Google maps claims it's about 100km one way, considering we rode the entire
Longleaf Trace in a day which was about 140km, this should be pretty doable.

  
  
  
There are a couple things I am expecting to be a challenge however. First,
unlike the Longleaf Trace, there will not be rest stops along the way with
cold water fountains and bathrooms. Second, we will be lugging all our camping
gear with us. I was unable to purchase a set of panniers for my bike, so I
will be carrying a fair amount in a backback with some items on my luggage
rack.

  
  
  
It appears the front hub on my bike has gone bad, so for now im using the
wheel from another bike I have, a quick test ride and it felt better than it
has felt in some time, guess that hub has been going bad for a while. Time to
upgrade to a nice heavy duty sealed hub I think.

  
  
  
I'll be bringing Karen's camera with me, so hopefully I will get some good
pics.
