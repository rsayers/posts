July is halfway over and I really havn't done a thing with my project, but I'm
finally changing that.

  

I actually sat down to take the Famicom apart earlier this week only to
discover the screws holding it together require a bit I don't already have.  I
placed an order with
[http://www.nintendorepairshop.com/](http://www.nintendorepairshop.com/) for
the bit I needed along with some cleaning solution for edge connectors.  I
ordered the Snes version in hopes that the Famicom was the same... turns out
it is.

  

I also went to the store to get the ingredients for retr0bright which I'll be
making tomorrow.  Assuming the weather cooperates (we've had water falling
from the sky recently... I'm not sure what that's all about) the Famincom
should look good as new this weekend.

  

I snapped a couple pics so you can see what it looks like now.  Lots of
yellowing, the bottom shows you how bad it really is.
