Tomorrow I'm going to Lake Charles LA for the 4th of July Weekend. 3 day
weekend at a lakehouse. Sounds fun.

  
  
  
I've entered the 2009 [RetroChallenge](http://www.retrochallenge.net/). I
surprised myself with my TRS80 Basic skills. I guess its like riding a bike.

  
  
  
I'm attempting to get motivated to work on my car again. I purchased flywheel
bolts, the last part keeping me from actually putting the engine in the car.
Perhaps next weekend we'll get that in there. I think a major step like that
will be good for getting momentum going again.

  
  
  
I'm rebuilding the engine in Karens car soon. Thankfully it's a 3 cyl.

  
  
  
I've registered for the [St Judes Marathon](http://www.stjudemarathon.org/) in
Memphis. Already started my 18 week training program, the Marathon is 22 weeks
away, so I have a little wiggle room.
