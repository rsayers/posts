Kowloon Walled City was a densely populated, largely ungoverned city within a city in Hong Kong.  Originally a Chinese fort, it passed to British control and eventually became a haven for refugees, squatters, unlicensed dentists, and organized crime.

I&#8217;ve been fascinated with this place ever since learning about it in the video game Shenmue 2.  Although the city was demolished in 1994, the game was set in the 80&#8217;s and allowed you to explore the city in quite a bit of detail.

Recently I stumbled across [City Of Darkness Revisited](http://cityofdarkness.co.uk/).  This is the website that acompanies a book of the same title.  The book is quite pricey, and so I&#8217;m unlikely to purchase it anytime soon.  The site however, if full of great content.

Of course the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kowloon_Walled_City) is probably the best starting point, the City of Darkness site is the best resource I&#8217;ve come across for getting a feel what this place was really like.
