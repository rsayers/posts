This summer's retrochallenge project will be a Kim1 simulator. The goal is to
have it working in html/js so one could program it from a browser. I've never
actually put hands on one of these devices, but there's a lot of documentation
out there, and really 6502 machine code is pretty easy. The Kim1 had a lot of
IO that I obviously wont be able to simulate, but hopefully the project is
worthwhile.
