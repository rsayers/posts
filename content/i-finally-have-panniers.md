Thanks to a 72% off sale at Nashbar.com last week, I have some new goods.

  

  
  

  * Set of powerbar branded sunglasses. Nothing fancy, but they were $5 and I needed a set, I always lose or break them anyhow, so this price was perfect
  
  

  * Euro-style cycling hat. Looks a bit silly, but I dig it.
  
  

  * 4 Contenental 26x1.25 tubes. What a steal, I have trouble finding these locally, and these were $1.50 each!
  
  

  * And finally, nashbar day trekker panniers. Ive been meaning to get some of these for a while, they are nice to have. I keep my rain poncho, gloves, skullcap, tools and other crap in here, no more need to carry stuff on my back!
