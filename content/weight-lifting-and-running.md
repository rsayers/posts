For the past month or so I have been running about twice per week in
preperation for a 5k. On of my major goals this year was to complete a race.
While a 5k will seem like weaksauce to a lot of people, it was a challenge for
me. Before training for this, the longest I have ever run non-stop was a mile,
so getting that up to 3 required a bit of work.

  
  
  
I'm pretty sure my cycling helped a little bit, but the two activities barely
compare, something which surprised me a little. In any event, last Saturday I
did complete my first 5k in a little over 27 minutes, a time I'm very happy
with. There's another 5k on the 25th of this month I plan to participate in as
well. Thinking more long term, there's a marathon in December which a coworker
of mine runs, I'm told that at my current fitness I could do a typical 16 week
training schedule and be ready in time to run that. While it would be amazing
to do something like that, I'd like to keep up with running in general before
setting such a goal. We will see i guess.

  
  
  
Last night I started lifting again. I'm following a routine I used about a
year ago with great results: [12 weeks to war ready guns.](http://www.t-nation

_guns) It's completely an arm routine, which is what I need since my upper
body is looking pretty small since I quit lifting. I feel I get enough of a
lower body workout from cycling (my quads are pretty big already).

  
  
  
Feels good to be lifting again, and running is much more enjoyable than I ever
thought it would be. Happy with the direction my body is headed.
