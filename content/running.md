As I prepare for the St Judes Memphis Marathon this December, my miles have
been increasing gradually. I started running earlier this year with a goal of
running a 5k. At the time it seemed like a huge feat to run 3 miles. I'm at a
point now where my shortest runs are 3 miles, and my last long run was 15.

  
  
  
The weather is getting cooler which has me in high spirits. We had a brief
cold front last week and I was able to do 8 miles at a 10 minute pace, not at
all fast, but fast for me. This has shown that I'm not as horrible as I
thought with all the previous longer runs in the 12 minute range.

  
  
  
Tonight I ran at a new track which I think I will use for my short runs from
now on. It's extremely hilly and each lap is 1/3 mile as opposed to the flat
1/4 mile track I had used in the past. The hill work was harder than expected
but doing so should help me a lot.

  
  
  
Tonight I also ran for the first time with a heart rate monitor. It was
interesting having an eye on what my body was doing, but I need to read more
into what my goals should be while running. After my run I ran a final lap
with no shoes. I've been reading more about the bare-foot running trend that
is getting popular and thought I would give it a try. After an akward start,
it really became natural and felt easier despite being tired from the previous
12 laps. I plan to work in some no-shoes running as I can, but may end up
going shoeless for good.
