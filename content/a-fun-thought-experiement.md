I was recently thinking about the common services people use from Google.
Search, Mail, Maps, Gtalk. Say you use these servcies daily as most people do.
If you perform a search while logged in, you'll notice a date next to links
you've already clicked... what you click is being saved, I would imagine
searches in general are also being saved. I often just type the name of a site
I want to visit in my search bar rather than a url, so Google knows many of
the sites I visit.

  
  
  
Next is mail, this is a no brainer. There are already contextual ads being
served, so you know your content is being parsed somehow. All your
correspondence is saved oon their servers. Gtalk is the same but for IM. Your
conversations are also being stored.

  
  
  
Google Maps is where it gets interesting, since it's often used for route
planning, Google knows where you are thinking about going. Got an iPhone or
Blackberry with Google Maps and a GPS? Now in additon to the above, they know
where I am at any time!

  
  
  
Now I'm not suggesting Google has any nafarious plans, but its almost a little
unsettling to know that so much information about you is stored by one entity.
Just something to think about.
