The [Retrochallenge](http://www.retrochallenge.org/) is almost here once more!  Huzzah!

This time around I'm going to be taking a random Apple //e that I've had for years, and do something useful with it.  I've had this idea floating around for a while of taking an Apple 2 and setting it up as a serial terminal for a nice desk decoration and distraction-free hacking environment, so I'm finally going to make that happen.

The computer in question is this lovely lady:

I have no earthly idea where I got this thing, and it has certainly looked better in the past, but it does work as I've had it setup in the past couple years to play some games from [The Apple Disk Server](http://asciiexpress.net/diskserver/). It has an 80 column card and I have a Super Serial card floating around somewhere, which should provide everything I need to set this up as a terminal.  I might need to source some floppy disks to get it bootstrapped,  but I'll solve those fun problems along the way.
