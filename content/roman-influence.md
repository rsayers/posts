It's no secret that I'm a Roman history nerd.  There's just something about
this society that I find fascinating.  One aspect that I find particularly
interesting is how Rome has influenced modern times.  Even 1500 years after
Rome fell,  it stil creeps into the daily lives of each and every one of us in
the Americas, Western Europe, and more.

  

I learned of a particular example I thought was really neat.  The Romans had a
goddess named Juno.  One of her forms was Juno the Warner, or in Latin: Juno
Moneda.  By coincidence, the Roman mint was located in her temple.  Because of
this, the term Ad moneda (to Moneda) became associated with currency.  This
eventually spread to the various Romance langauges including French where it
became "monnaie".

  

It is from French the word made its way into English as "money".  Cool, no?
