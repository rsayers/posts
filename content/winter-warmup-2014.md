I've realized it seems like the only thing I blog about anymore is
retrocomputing. That said, I'm getting in gear for The [RetroChallenge Winter
Warmup 2014](http://www.retrochallenge.org/).

This go around my project is to
build a computer based on the 6502 cpu. I'm using the basic design [found
here](http://searle.hostei.com/grant/6502/Simple6502.html). I don't expect to
win since this is hardly uncharted territory, but it seems like a cool project
anyhow and something I've been wanting to do for some time. 

I've already
placed my order with Jameco for all the components I need, I've ordered a
cheap eprom writer from ebay, and have been reading up on similar projects to
gather more information. I'm feeling pretty confident I can do this. Good luck
to all the other participants!
