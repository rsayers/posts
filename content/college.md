Today I completed the freshmen preview at USM. I now need to purchase books,
but other than that, I'm ready to show up on day 1 and get my learn on.

  
  
  
Starting college at 27 is a bit strange, too young to be considered adult
education, so I was grouped with the ~18 crowd all day. One of those times I
felt lucky that I look younger than I am. I was sure to get a close shave
before I left this morning.

  
  
  
This semester I am taking English I, College Algebra, Physics I, Religion I,
and Anthropology I. Aside from the English requirements, all the classes
required for my major seem very interesting, so I imagine I will enjoy them.
I'm taking 14 hours this semester with 1 class being an online class, I think
that will be pretty manageable.
