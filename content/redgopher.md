After getting my Tandy on the internet I wanted to use it to browser some
gopher sites. The issue is the standard gopher client and lynx did not work
well on such a limited terminal. Even though curses would play nice, those
particular apps were just not usable. I went ahead and wrote a really simple
client to suit my needs.

  
  
  
I'm calling it RedGopher, as it's written in Ruby. I spent quite a bit of time
browsing around with it last night and it worked well, it can use a completley
dumb terminal or use less to page your output if your terminal type is set
correctly.
