Introducing a new series of articles detailing how to build a software
emulator for a physical platform. Each article will detail different aspects
of designing and implementing an emulator.

The platform I'll be emulating is the Apple 1. I picked this specifically
because it's a well known platform, based on a CPU I already know better than
any other, and is a fairly simple platform. Since the exercise is to learn how
to emulate a platform, and also write about it along the way, I think those
factors make the Apple1 a good choice.

As for the programming language, I'll be using Python. The main reason is
completely selfish, I'm starting to use Python professionally, and a task like
this will help sharpen my skills. Python also has the added benefit of being
very easy to understand no matter what language you use normally. Even if you
are not familiar with the language, you should be able to port the code I
write to your platform of choice if you care to follow along.

The first article in the series will detail writing a generic 6502 cpu
emulator which will be at the heart of the system.
