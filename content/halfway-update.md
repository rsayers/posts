I've been a little quiet about my project lately, so here's an update. With
Real Life(tm) things going on, I've had to sneak in time as I can, so my
progress has been a little slow going. 

That said, I had started working on
implementing more opcodes into the emulator... when I realized this stuff is
hard! My goal here was really to have a functioning, in-browser, Kim-1.
Emulating the 6502 was a neccesary side effect of that. Thankfully, I have
found [http://6502asm.com/](http://6502asm.com/) which already has a GPL'd
emulator written in javascript. While this emulator is somewhat tightly
coupled to the page on which it runs, it looks like the bulk of the code
relates to assembling source into machine code. Since my app has the user
doing that anyhow, I can extract just the portion that runs the machine code.
From what I can tell, this should make it pretty easy to work with the
existing data structures I have in the code so far. 

Also on the subject on
retrostuffs, yesterday I went by the Retro Games Fest here in Austin. It was a
pretty neat setup. Lot's of old hardware to see, several vintage arcade
cabinets setup, and rows of old consoles setup and free to play. The real
treat for me was seeing a real Macintosh 512k in person. Before this the
oldest Mac I've had my hands on was a Mac Plus, so this was way cool. I have a
few pics that I've shared over at [Google +](https://plus.google.com/photos/11
