Title: Going from the iPad to Nexus 7 - One month in

In late March I put my iPad 3G up for sale, and purchased a Nexus 7.

  
Like a lot of people who like gadgets, the grass always seems greener, and
with the release of the Nexus 7 and 10, it looked like the Android platform
may have a real competitor to the iPad.  I preordered my iPad3 the day it was
announced.  I was not a regular Apple customer before that, having
transisioned from OSX to Linux back in 2010, the last Apple product I bought
was an iPod Touch in 2011 to bring along on my trip to Tokyo.

  
I had been an Android user since the Nexus One,  but I would not consider
myself a huge cheerleader of the platform.  It has issues now,  and it sure as
hell had issues then (the Froyo days).  As much as I like the platform,  I
would happily concede that Apple delivered a better user experience in the
iPhone.

  
That is until Android 4.0/Jellybean shipped.  In my opinion the OS is just
more intuitive and I can get to what I want faster than I can in iOS.  When I
had my iPod Touch, I found that I used it at home for mobile web more often
than my phone (which was a Nexus S at the time) and this was certainly true
with the iPad.  Once I got my Nexus 4, however, I realized I was using my
tablet a lot less.  It's not that the phone offered a better experience,  but
it wasn't enough of a difference to warrant me going to pick up the iPad
wherever it was in the house just to look up a recipe or what not.

  
So with that long-winded background on my platform preferences... how do I
feel about switching tablets?  Honestly it just occured to me today that I had
not thought of it since doing so.  I have not missed my iPad once.

  
Things I like better about the Nexus 7:

  * Smaller size.  This worried me most when I was switching.  I thought I would eventually kick myself for losing so much screen real estate.  Instead I find it much easier to tote around, read with, or use when I'm in bed.
  * Cheaper.  Price matters... thanks to Apples great resale value, i didn't lose that much when I sold it.  I was able to cover the cost of the N7 and a lot more.  On top of that, I find that I'm less neurotic about protecting it.  I treated my iPad like a holy relic,  the cost to replace was just too non-trivial.  The Nexus 7 still lives without a case (I just can't find one I like!)
  * It's Android.  Aside from Android catching up with iOS in looks in usability (highly subjective, I know), there's a few other reasons I like it.  Since I run a Linux desktop,  interacting with it is much easier than it was with an iOS device.  Also if I want to develop for the platform,  the SDK is a download a away and I can hack together quick utility programs quickly for personal use.    I would need to buy a whole new machine to do this on iOS.
Of course it's not all roses.  There are some things I do miss about iOS.

  

  * That glorious retina display.  After using the iPad for so long, you become spoiled by how good it looks.  When looking at lesser LCDs, all I can see are the pixels.  Thankfully the N7 isn't terrible in this respect,  but it's a clear difference between it and the iPad.
  * The App Store.  This has been improving on Android since I started using it, but I still think that the App Store leads in overall quality of apps.  I've developed an Android app that was devleoped along side the iOS version,  and after seeing what the iOS guys get in development, it's no water Android lags.  That said,  Google's less restrictive policies do allow more types of apps such as emulators and bittorrent clients, and loading from 3rd party sources requires me to change a system preference, not root the device.
  * Support.  The fact that iOS is so popular and standardized means that accessory companies can make addons that fit the entire iPhone/iPod/iPad range.  Since Android is way more scattered, you don't see this as much, although it's getting better.  I guess this is not a huge deal for me since I don't accessorize much, but it's nice to know I can if I wanted.
The biggest difference really is screen size.  I watch a lot of Netflix and
Hulu on my tablet, and I was afraid that experience would be ruined for me.
Thankfully it's been a non issue.

  
I'm not writing this to pursuede anyone to one device or another,  but if
you're in the air between the two, hopefully this post can be of some help.
