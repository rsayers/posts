Title: RC Winter Warmup 2013: The Revenge

So instead of picking a new project for the 2013 Winter Warmup, I've decided
to complete the projects that were unfinished from the previous two:  I'm
going to get my Replica 1 kit working, and restore my Super Famicom.

  
I had my Replica 1 mostly working... but something somewhere is messed up,  so
I need to get out the multimeter and magnifying glass to track it down.

  
I had fully disassembled my Super Famicom to prepare it for the Retr0bright
treatment... and then ended up with a broken arm, so that project got
derailed.

  
I also recently built a [Pocket Mini
Computer](http://propellerpowered.com/shop/?page_id=234),  which isn't exactly
retro, but it designed to act like a retro machine... so maybe I'll include
some of the fun I find with that in my updates as well.
