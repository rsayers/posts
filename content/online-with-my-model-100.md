I finally have my Tandy Model 100 on the internet, I am using it to write this
post in fact. I'm using a Lantronix UDS10 to connect. It connects to the trs80
via serial, and to the network with ethernet, I actuallly telnet out by typing
atdtxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/pp with the ip address and port. I had to lower the speed
from its default 9600 to 2400 as the machines LCD will not work that fast.

  
  
  
I have the correct terminfo entry, so most things work fine, can't quite get
emacs to work, so im typing this in vi.

  
  
  
This is neat!
