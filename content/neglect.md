Title: Neglect

I've been neglecting this website as well as others lately. This is something
I intend to correct. I have a couple specialty blogs that I (somewhat)
maintain that I intend to merge into this one. I will start keeping the
majority of everything I post here, and as a result, the content here should
diversify.

  
  
  
I also feel that I've been missing something by not writing more often,
blogging is an outlet I've always enjoyed but something I have done less of as
I get older. I have raised my own standards of what I should post to that
point that I rarely do. I am going to try and relax this a bit and post more
frequently.

  
  
  
So in honor of this, I've created a new theme for the site which you see now
unless you are reading over rss. This will be merged back into the blog source
code and will be the default theme once I get some kinks worked out.
