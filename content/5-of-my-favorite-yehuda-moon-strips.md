[Yehuda Moon](http://yehudamoon.com/) is my favorite comic for obvious
reasons. I really like the fact that it captures the "little things" about
cycling, those things you can only appreciate if you ride a good bit.

  
  
  
There are a few strips especially which stand out, I'd like to share them
here.

I was pleased to use this exact line when someone offered me a ride the last
time it snowed here.

One nice thing about riding a bike is that the slower pace gives you a chance
to see things you'd miss in a car.

I'm really guilty of this. A set of trekking bars just gives you so many
options for placing things :)

Maybe the worst part of bike commuting... ugh

I don't think motorists understand the doppler effect, this happens pretty
frequently
