I finally tracked down a disk drive in my garage.  Considering I've never really used one,  I seem to own a lot of C64s.  I think I counted 3 of them today.  That's a system I really need to play with at some point.

So in the course of trying to get the case clean, i had the idea to see what it would look like if I just plastidipped the case.  I think I like it.  It has sort of a stealth bomber look to it... as much as an 80's computer can look like a jet I guess.  The nice thing is that PlastiDip is a plastic coating that comes off fairly easy, so nothing permanent.

I've been going over the monitor situation for a while now, and I really wanted to go with a CRT as I've read that old machines have issue displaying color properly on an LCD.  Ultimately I didn't want to deal with a large, heavy, screen that would take up a ton of space on my desk.  So I went with a small LCD used in car entertainment systems.  It's a 7" screen which I'm hoping will be fine.  I can see small text with ease on my old EeePc of the same size,  so maybe this will work too?  At the very least, I should be fine in 40 column mode, although I was really hoping to be able to handle 80.

I also decided to order the serial adapter I needed at the same time.  Should all be here Monday or Tuesday, and then I'll actually turn this thing on and start transferring disk images over.
