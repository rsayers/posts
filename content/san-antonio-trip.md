Had a great time this weekend. Rode to San Antonio for Ryan's bachelor party
along with Rory, Branden, Havard, Matthew, Mark, and Jake. We went to Six
flags and visited the Alamo. I won't go into too much detail since Ryan
already did [an excellent job](http://thedingo.net/blog/2008/11/10/bachelor-
party-insanity/) at that already.

  
  
  
Six Flags was great, I think we rode every single roller coaster, several of
them twice, and a couple other misc rides. The Rattler, a large wooden coaster
was by far the best. I like wooden coasters to modern ones anyhow, but this
tops the previous 2 I've been on, riding it a second time did not make it less
terrifying.

  
  
  
Dinner on Saturday was at Pappadeaux's, a Cajun place, I had the Poppy Seed
yellow fin tuna which was beyond good. This might have been the best
restaurant at which I've ever eaten. After dinner we went down town to the
river walk which was a beautiful section of town where most of the nightlife
is. Really wish we had something even close in Hattiesburg.

  
  
  
Sunday we hit up the Alamo, it's much smaller than I imagined. Historical
sites always impress me, and this one was no exception. Saw several items
which actually belonged to David Crockett among others. It's neat to see
tangible evidence of stories you've heard all your life.

  
  
  
On the way home we went to an Ikea in Houston. This place takes furniture to a
new level. The cafeteria was great also, had Swedish meatballs, yum.

  
  
  
The best part however was just spending time with some of my closest friends,
I was glad the trip worked out as well as it did.
