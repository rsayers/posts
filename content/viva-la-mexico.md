Still having a blast in Mexico City. I think this is the most fashionable city
Ive ever seen. Finally figured out our way around the subway, its fast and mad
cheap.

  
  
  
We are at an internet cafe now, 10 pesos per hour is so much cheaper than the
150 pesos per day our hotel was charging us for slow wifi access.

  
  
  
Today is a shopping day, yesterday we say the zoo and Museum of Anthrepology.
Tomorrow we visit Teoteucan (sp?).
