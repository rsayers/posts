A lot happened in 2008, here's the rundown!

  
  
  
Started 2008 in Curacao partying it up and shooting fireworks. That was the
last time I visited the island.

  
  
  
Early in the year the company for which I worked went under. For a period of
time before that, there was no work to do while I was still getting paid, this
was a nice period of self growth. I was living with my dad at the time, and
having no bills and no real job gave me a lot of free time which I feel I used
wisely.

  
  
  
In April I got a job at Megagate, where I am currently employed. I started out
in tech support and eventually got promoted to web development.

  
  
  
In June Karen and I got married. We had a beautiful ceremony at her Church in
Jackson. I'm very lucky to have married such a swell gal. I'm enjoying the
married life very much.

  
  
  
After the wedding, we went to Mexico City for our honeymoon. We spent 10 days
checking out one of the largest cities on earth. We had a blast, learned some
spanish, drank a lot of cerveza, and climbed pyramids.

  
  
  
I started college in August. I started as a physics major but switched to
religion halfway through the semester. I enjoy the active learning process a
lot and can't wait for next semester to start.

  
  
  
Karen and I acquired a dog, a cute little chihuahua named Mia. She is the best
dog ever, way cuter than yours.

  
  
  
Two of my best friends, Ryan and Bonita were married in November, I was
honored to perform the ceremony, as well as being very nervous. The wedding
was great and everyone had a good time.

  
  
  
2008 was good, here's to a good 2009, L'Chaim!
