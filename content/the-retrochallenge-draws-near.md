I'm excited about the upcoming[ Retrochallenge Winter
Warmup.](http://www.wickensonline.co.uk/retrochallenge-website/tiki-
index.php?page=HomePage) The past few I've either dropped out or didnt compete
at all.  This time I've finally got the time and motivation to get a project
going!

  

This time around my project is to assemble a [Replica
1](http://www.brielcomputers.com/replica1.html) kit computer.  It's a pretty
close replica of the Apple 1, a computer I've long wanted but will never be
able to afford.  This is even better since I get to assemble it myself.

  

The kit arrived tonight and looks like it will be a ton of fun to build.  If I
get it done quick enough, I want to do something interesting with it as a side
project... we'll see how that goes though.  I hate that I have to wait until
the first to get started.
