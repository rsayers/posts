So I'm finally getting started on my project.  I've acquired a box of blank floppy disks, and now I need a monitor, and a db9->db25 adapter so I can connect my laptop to the Apple to transfer disk images.  I'll probably pay the here-and-now tax at Radio Shack assuming they still carry things like that,  and I'll check Craigslist for a TV to use.  Last I checked there were quite a few being given away for free.

Tonight however was all about cleaning.  I removed the case from the magic parts, and got to work scrubbing.  The case got much less clean than I had hoped,  I think restoring this thing will require retr0bright.  That is of course assuming I want to restore the stock color and not do something crazy...

I'll post pics of the completed case work tomorrow.
