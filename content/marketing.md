Marketing is an interesting field. It is one in which I never hope to work,
but I still admire.

  
  
  
I watch very little broadcast television, so I miss many commercials. Perhaps
it is because of this I tend to notice the ones that I do see. I have
determined 2 things which I notice in many ads:

  

  
  

  1. **When marketing to men**: This product will get you laid
  
  

  2. **When marketing to women**: This product will make your friends jeleous
  
  
  
  
Nothing Earth-shattering here, just something I see over and over and found
interesting.
