I've recently been hard at work on a new site about cycling. It is in a soft
launch phase now as I sort out some details and get some more content up, but
it's almost ready to promote.

  
  
  
The site is called [Velobration](http://www.velobration.com/), a joining of
the words "velo" and "celebration". It is fairly general in its topics, and
the overall aim is to highlight anything cool or interested related to
cycling. I plan to keep it light on reposts and have a hair amount of original
content. Take a look and let me know what you think!
