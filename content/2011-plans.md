We're already knee deep into 2011, but a [post from
Bonita](http://www.bonitajaynes.com/2011/02/15/to-do-in-2011/) on the subject
of goals reminded me that I have wanted to post on the subject as well.  My
head is filled with things I want to do, putting a list down should help me
solidify that a little bit.

  


  

  

  1. Run the Warrior Dash - 3 mile run with mud and obstacles.  I've run several 5k's, but this should have a lot of added difficulty.  Also, I don't merely want to finish, I want to do well.
  

  2. Get in better shape - I turn 30 this year and it has hit me that half-assing my fitness isn't going to cut it anymore.  If I want to have the body, strength, and endurance that I want I will really need to push for it.  I'm in week 3 of P90X right now and my immediate goal is just to finish it. After that I'll see what I want to do.
  

  3. Visit Europe - Aside from a 2 hour stop is Brussels on my way to India, I've never been to Europe.  Karen and I have decided to vacation in Rome and Malta this year.  After that I'll just need to hit mainland South America and Africa.  Antarctica seems unlikely unless I apply for another job there.
  

  4. Take up another sport - I find that having a sport on which to focus is good for me.  I havn't been involved in anything since I quit Brazilian Jiu JItsu in 2005.  I'm not 100% sure what I want to do, but I have an intro class at a local fencing school soon, so we'll see if that's a good fit for me.
  

  5. Get my degree - As long as I stay on task I should be getting my B.S. in I.T./Software this November... here's hoping.
  

  6. Get into mountain biking - I want to get back into riding, and now that I live somewhere with good trails I can finally get into mountain biking like I've always wanted to... just need to buy a bike now.
  

  7. Get a project scooter - One would think the ruckus is enough of a project, but I want to pick up a 2stroke bike to start working on a drag project.
