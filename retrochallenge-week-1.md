I started to assemble my Replica1 kit this week.  I could not mind my trusty
old Radio Shack iron, so I went down to the Shack and picked up a new one.
There was one slight problem though... it was total rubbish.

  

It had been so long since I last soldered that I thought I was just out of
practice,  but after soldering in most of the resisters and it not getting
easier, i realized (read: hoped) it was my cheap soldering iron at fault.

  

After a trip to Fry's, I came home with a nice soldering station with
adjustable wattage.  I also picked up an adjustable power supply to run this
thing once it's build, a db9 connector which appears to have been omitted from
the kit, and a new battery for my multimeter.

  

This morning I decided to try out the iron to see how well it worked...
success!  I managed to get the rest of the resisters, the momemtary switches,
and all the sockets installed.  I hope to have all it all put together by the
end of the week.
