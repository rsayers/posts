I'm planning a reinstall of Linux on this server and slightly changing the
purpose of the machine.

  
  
  
When I first purchased this linode, it was simply to have a personal server
for web and email. Because of this everyone was setup just so for me. After my
recent package management fits I decided I wanted a distro which gave me more
control over operations, so I'm switching to Slackware. When this occurs, my
domains will be hosted as virtuals along with the others I already host.

  
  
  
My goal is to setup the machine as sort of a public access system to provide
hosting and shell accounts for those who want them, as well as give me
experience with the setup and administration that comes with that.

  
  
  
I will be using another domain as the main domain name. I may use
coffeeconverter.com or pick a new one completely, I've yet to decide.

  
  
  
I'm in the process now of setting everything up on a local VM before moving it
all live. I have this completed before the end of next week.
