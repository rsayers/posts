Title: Austin Texas to Piedras Negras Mexico

Tomorrow morning at about 4am I'll be departing Austin Texas and heading to
Piedras Negras Mexico for the weekend. This alone is not terribly exciting, so
I've also decided to make the trip on my Honda Ruckus.

  
  
  
For those who aren't familiar with it, the Ruckus us a 49cc scooter which tops
out somewhere between 35 and 40mph. Mine is slightly modified and I can cruise
at 40 on flat ground and hit between 45 and 50mph on an apporoprite downhill
road. Needless to say it's pretty slow and the trip will be long. I estimate I
can cover the 230 miles in about 8 hours. I'll have to stop at least 3 times
just for gas, and because I can't take interstates, I'll be stuck on roads
with red lights. Thankfully much of the trip takes place in the middle of no
where, so it might not be that bad.

Google Latitude the whole time, so if you'd like to track my progress, send a
Latitude request to [rsayers@gmail.com](mailto:rsayers@gmail.com).

  
  
  
I've made a couple modifications to the Ruckus in preperation. I've added a
12v outlet to charge my phone, rigged up some highway pegs for my feet, and am
using the o-ring trick for cruise control. I know the scooter is ready, let's
up the rider is also.

  
  
  
Wish me luck!
