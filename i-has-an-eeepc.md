Today I acquired an Asus eeePC. So far I really like it. It's a white 4g with
1gig of ram. I got it used and it had Xp on it, but that has been wiped and
its now running eeedora, a version of Fedora designed for this platform.

  
  
  
My only complaint is the tiny keyboard, its very difficult to type. On this
post alone I think i've hit backspace ore than any other key. I imagine that
will get better with practice however.
